The aim of this work is to predict the hospital readmission of heart failure patients 6 months after the discharge. This
would allow not only to prepare the resources for future hospitalizations, but it could also give insights about the
importance of some clinical variables in order to ensure their recording at the time of the first hospitalization.

The dataset comes from a retrospective single-center observational study to collect data regarding the characteristics of heart failure patients in China by integrating electronic
healthcare records and follow-up outcome data. The study collected information for a total of 2,008 patients with heart failure, containing 166 attributes.
