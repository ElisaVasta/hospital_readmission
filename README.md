# Heart Failure Hospital Readmission Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the 6-month hospital readmission rates for heart failure patients post-discharge. By forecasting future hospitalizations, we intend to facilitate resource planning and provide insights into the significance of clinical variables recorded during the initial hospitalization.

## Data Source
The dataset utilized in this study is derived from a retrospective single-center observational study conducted in China. The study integrates electronic healthcare records with follow-up outcome data for heart failure patients, encompassing 2,008 individuals and 166 distinct attributes.

## Dataset Information
Comprehensive details about the dataset can be found in the publication:
["Electronic healthcare records and external outcome data for hospitalized patients with heart failure"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00835-9) published in Scientific Data by Nature.

## Data Access
The dataset is available for download at:
[Springer Nature Figshare](https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Metadata_record_for_Electronic_healthcare_records_and_external_outcome_data_for_hospitalized_patients_with_heart_failure/13064054).

## Methodology
The methodology includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and the application of various statistical learning techniques to predict readmission rates.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset from the provided Figshare link.
2. Refer to the publication in Nature for data understanding and attributes explanation.
3. Run the analysis scripts to perform the prediction task.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
